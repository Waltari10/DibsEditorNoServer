Sky, constantly changing but everywhere same.
Our souls will be immortal.
For a moment, we are infinite.
A soul lives in creating.
Ones that are never forgotten are truly immortal.
Life continues in our heritage.
We all leave something behind.
In our creative work, we shed our souls.
Our souls are tormented by misfortune of life.
Compassion is stronger than hate.
We are truly soulful when we turn misfortune into fortune.
Happiness is already here. Discover it.
I think but I am not my thoughts.
I feel but I am not my feelings.
What an odd world we live in!
Stop. Breathe.
See the invisible.
Our bodies are statues.
Eat what your body wants.
Sensitivity is strength.
Be yourself, always.
Showing weakness is strength.
Do not forget me.
Do not just dream it, be it.
Appreciation before judging.
This is a start, not the end.
There is only new beginnings.
Take care of yourself and others.
Pass the good forward.
Do not be afraid of making decisions.
Be grateful for things you take for granted.
Nature takes care of us.
Live for today, not for the past or future.
Timing matters in everything.
Perfect timing.
Never feel discouraged by small things.
Rhythm is everything.
Feel the rhythm of life beating.
The beat comes from the heart.
Sing from the heart.
If i die, i die singing.
Our souls live on, in music.
You feel the swing, breathe the beat.
Nothing as beautiful as a song with no inhibitions.
An artist never gives up.
Vision is something to have.
Become a champion.
I am nothing but a small fairy looking for someone to clap for me.
Dibs me? I dare you.
i dibs u!
Want it? Come and get it.
Insert quote here.
Ok baby, I will let you drive my car.
Love me or leave me.
Come or go, I will be here.
Want it? Come and get it.
Our hearts are sweet.
I will hold your hand, honey.
Alone or together after Jazz?
We are wonderful.
Love, be loved.
Get inspired.
Love is for lions. Rour.
There is no easy love.
In a minute I hate you but in a second I fall in love with you again.
We are sweet like cinnamon.
We are no heroes, just children of the sun.
Are we too young to die, too afraid to live?
Everything that happens is inevitable.
No regrets.
We only regret what we left undone.
Cannot change the past but you can change future.
Today is just a yesterday tomorrow.
Life is never dancing on the roses.
Good comes from good.
In war there is only casualties.
Peace belongs to everyone.
Be brave enough to change the world and you will.
I dont always have time to study, but when I do, I don’t.
‘Party hard’ is my middle name.
‘Quote’… what? It told me to write it.
Never will I give up on being cheeky.
Nothing as sweet as saving a damsel in distress on a Saturday evening.
I am a cheeky girl.
Girls love cheeky boys!
I need a hero on a Saturday night.
Will you save me from this club?
Yesterday is only a blur.
Must’ve been a good night.
Live for the moment, do not worry for tomorrow.
What happened last night?!
Tomorrow is tomorrow.
Dibs is the most powerful force in the universe.
Always mind.
You are a summer to my heart.
Four seasons combines the perfect love.
